Trend and Pattern Summary:
Air Temperature shows a clear seasonal pattern with highs in summer and lows in winter.
Although not as strong of a trend, Humidity seems to have slight seasonal variations as well, stabilizing in Winter while having highs and lows in the Summer.
Wind Speed does not seem to follow the same seasonal patterns as Temperature and Humidity.
All three variables overall seem to be stable in the long term.
Correlation Analysis:
The highest correlation seen is between Air Temperature and Wet Bulb Temperature, which is to be expected, as both are temperatures.
Air Temperature shows a mild positive correlation with Total Rain, indicating that higher temperatures may be associated with increased rainfall in this dataset.
Humidity has a moderate negative correlation with Temp Ratio, suggesting that as humidity increases, the difference of Wet Bulb to Air Temperature decreases.
