Key Findings

Model Performance:
The best performing model was the linear regression model (R^2 = .013)
Neither model had a strong performance.
Feature Importance:
Total Rain was the most important feature at .0467.
The other two features, Wet Bulb Temperature and Wind Speed 24h Rolling were of equal importance at .27 and .26 respectively.
Temporal Patterns:
Temperature had very visible seasonal fluctuations, and humidity had slightly less strong seasonal fluctuations.
Data Quality:
Dataset Cleaned: 196315 -> 120367 rows.
Values from one station were removed due to entire columns of missing data.
The remaining values and outliers were filled using ffill() (with 2 values in Solar Radiation being filled with bfill() due to being the last two values in the dataset.)
Outliers were decided using IQR method
