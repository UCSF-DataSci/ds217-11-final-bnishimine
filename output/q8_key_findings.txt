Key Findings

Model Performance:
The best performing model was the random forest model (R^2 = 0.757)
Both models had a moderate performance. However, the random forest model slightly outperformed linear regression. An important note is that random forest performed above 0.7, whereas linear regression did not.
Feature Importance:
Temperature Difference was the most important feature at 0.767.
The other two features, Total Rain and Month, were of lesser importance at 0.099 and 0.134 respectively.
Temporal Patterns:
Temperature had very visible seasonal fluctuations, and humidity had slightly less strong seasonal fluctuations.
Data Quality:
Dataset Cleaned: 196315 -> 120367 rows.
Values from one station were removed due to entire columns of missing data.
The remaining values and outliers were filled using ffill() (with 2 values in Solar Radiation being filled with bfill() due to being the last two values in the dataset.)
Outliers were decided using IQR method
